# Panacloud Command Line Interface

Panacloud, is the world's first API Ownership Economy platform. It is a multi-sided Ownership Platform For API-First Startups, SaaS API and App Developers, and Revenue-Based Investors (RBI). It fuses the API Economy with the Token and Ownership Economy. Technically, it merges serverless computing with AI, IoT, Blockchain, DeFi, Graph, and Quantum Computing Technologies. 

Panacloud CLI speeds up serverless SaaS API and App project development by providing project scaffolding, on which more powerful serverless SaaS APIs and Apps can be built. It provides the developers the ability to create a project skeleton and scaffolding by giving a single command. The developer just defines the API specification, and selects the cloud services he/she wants to use. To develop QraphQL API the schema is required, and for REST APIs the Open API specification are needed. Given the specs the SaaS API project code including infrastructure as code (IaC) is automatically generated by the CLI tool. For IaC it uses AWS CDK constructs. The generated serverless SaaS API project scaffolding supports multi-tenant billing and monetering and is closely integrated with the Panacloud portal. The developer just needs to write the specific code required by the Multi-Tenant SaaS project. This greatly reduces custom developer coding and increases speed to market. GraphQL and Open REST APIs can be built by using the Panacloud CLI. The APIs may use Graph or Relational databases, etc. Initially the Panacloud CLI is generating code for AWS using TypeScript only. In future, we plan to add support for Azure and Google Cloud, and other languages as well.

We have also published detailed [Tutorials](https://github.com/panacloud-modern-global-apps/full-stack-serverless-cdk) to help you to learn AWS CDK. 

Before getting started you need to install the following packages and libraries:

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Install [AWS CLI Version 2.x](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html)
3. Install [AWS CDK Version 2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/work-with-cdk-v2.html)
4. Install Globally [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/download)

Now Globally Install Panacloud CLI:

npm install @panacloud/cli -g
